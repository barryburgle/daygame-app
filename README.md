The main goal of this app it to provide a tool for measurement and improvement of your daygame.
All data are stored locally, on your device *only*. The app provides four tabs: 
- the Game Tab is where you can insert, see and delete all your sets, sessions and dates
- the Dashboard Tab is where you can observe your progress over time
- the Results Tab is where you can observe your overall statics
- the Settings Tab is where you can manage data and customize your app experience

## Project Roadmap

The future features are divided in:

| Color Code | Complexity Level | Focus On |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| ðŸŸ¢ | Easy | Data Traceability |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Complex | Player's Performance |
| ðŸ”´ | Hard | Analisys Experience Customization |
| âš« | Pro | Data acquisition delegation |

### Features

- [ ] ðŸŸ¢ `Dashboard Tab` Integrate some charts that plot the sum of sets/dates/contacts/lays from the start of the month/year comparing curves of the last n (settable from settings) months or years: the higher the curve the faster proceeds the "accumulation" of results on your behalf

- [ ] ðŸŸ¢ `Dashboard Tab` Customizable challenges (5-5, 10-10...) and medals. Challenge Data Model:

| Column name     | Details                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Challenge Id    | Primary Key Autogenerated Not Null |
| Start Date      | String Default Null                |
| End Date        | String Default Null                |
| Type            | String Not Null                    |
| Goal            | Integer Not Null                   |
| Completion      | Integer Not Null                   |
| Completion Date | String Default Null                |
| Events          | String Default Null                |

- [ ] ðŸŸ¢ `Results Tab` Funnel conversion ratios plot both for standard `set -> contact -> date -> lay` and SDL `set -> date -> lay` pipelines. In future should be able to set dates since-to to get the ratios and performances for a specific period.
- [ ] ðŸŸ¢ `Dashboard Tab` Leads last-contact tracker and "get back in touch" old leads list, with conversation tags: remember what you did talk about and what resonates. Lead Data Model extension:

| Column name | Details |
| ----------- | ------- |
| ... | ... |
| Last contact | String Timestamp Default Null |
| Last contact Type | Enum [ping, text, story reply, call, random meet, she gets back in touch, reason from user] Default Null |
| Conversation Tags | List<String> Default Null |

- [ ] ðŸŸ¢ `Sessions Tab` Live session insert red card with single sets' timestamp & geo tracking for future space-time windows analysis (when and where to go out on a statistical basis). When a session is live a persistent and interactive notification with proper + & - buttons for sets, conversations and contacts should be shown on device. Only one session can be a Live session at a time. Abstract Session Data Model extension:

| Column name | Details |
| ----------- | ------- |
| ... | ... |
| Live session | Boolean Default Null |

- [ ] ðŸŸ¢ `Sessions Tab` Insert a new in-past date-delimited period providing overall sets, conversations, contacts, dates and lays achieved (allow jaunts tracking and destinations comparison): overall statistics should be affected from this also. Period Data Model:

| Column name | Details |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Period Id | Primary Key Autogenerated Not Null |
| Start Date | String Default Null |
| End Date | String Default Null |
| City | String Not Null |
| Sets | Integer Not Null |
| Conversations | Integer Not Null |
| Contacts | Integer Not Null |
| Dates | Integer Not Null |
| Lays | Integer Not Null |

- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ `Sessions Tab` Post any new session/set/lead/date/challenge/period etc. on chosen protected Google Forms authorized by user login to preserve his data on the cloud. Alternatively create a recurrent backup procedure that exports all the table files and uploads those the user's Google Drive as a .zip archive.
- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ `Results Tab` Compute player class score from overall number of sets and lays.
- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ `Results Tab` Radar/Spider player chart (establish which measurable characteristics to plot and how to measure/assess them).
- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ `Dashboard Tab` Performance observer: a series of charts that allow you to see, through time, how your ratios changed going on and on. The performances should take into considerations main ratios between stages (sets -> conversations -> contacts -> dates -> lays) and at each moment along the time axis compute the ratios between the stages considering all that happened up to that point. Each chart, plotting the changing of a ratio through time, should be touchable and inspectable with a vertical line that both says the value of the ratio and the moment in time in which it was so.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ `Dashboard Tab` Possibility to insert your own custom (session/week/month performance) index formula.
-  [ ] ðŸ”´ `Settings Tab` Schema extendable database: new columns on existing tables, should be both insertable data or computable ones.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ `Dashboard Tab` Custom chart generation from extended tables.
- [ ] âš« `Sessions Tab` Live session stealth set recording (mic access, AI-based set detection, AI-based set record trim, settable record folder).
