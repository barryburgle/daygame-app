The main goal of this daygame app it to provide a tool for measurement and improvement of your daygame.
Everything is stored locally on your device. The app provides four tabs: 
- the Sessions Tab is where you can insert, see and delete all the sessions
- the Dashboard Tab is where you can observe your progress over time
- the Results Tab is where you can observe your statics
- the Settings Tab is where you can import or export data and customize your app experience

| Sessions Tab                                                                                               | Dashboard Tab                                                                                               | Results Tab                                                                                                | Settings Tab                                                                                               |

## What's next

The following are the features I thought could be useful in future, divided in 游릭 easy, 游리 complex and 游댮 hard to implement,

- [ ] 游릭 `Date Tab` Dates insert on input screen + dates table
- [ ] 游릭 `Sessions Tab` Odd set insert outside of a proper session: overall statistics should be affected from this also
- [ ] 游릭 `Results Tab` Funnel conversion ratios plot both for standard `set -> contact -> date -> lay` and SDL `set -> date -> lay` pipelines
- [ ] 游릭 `Dashboard Tab` Leads last-contact tracker and "get back in touch" old leads list
- [ ] 游리 `Sessions Tab` Live session insert red card with single sets' timestamp & geo tracking for future space-time windows analysis (when and where to go out on a statistical basis)
- [ ] 游릭 `Sessions Tab` Insert a past date-delimited period providing overall sets, conversations, contacts, dates and lays achieved (allow jaunts tracking and destinations comparison): overall statistics should be affected from this also
- [ ] 游리 `Results Tab` Radar/Spider player chart (establish which measurable characteristics to plot and how to measure/assess them)
- [ ] 游리 `Dashboard Tab` Possibility to insert your own custom (session/week/month performance) index formula
- [ ] 游댮 `Settings Tab` Schema extendable database: new columns on existing tables, should be both insertable data or computable ones
- [ ] 游댮 `Dashboard Tab` Custom chart generation from extended tables
- [ ] 游댮 `Sessions Tab` Live session stealth set recording (mic access, AI-based set detection, AI-based set record trim, settable record folder)
